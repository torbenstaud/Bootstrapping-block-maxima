# Bootstrapping-Estimators-based-on-the-Block-Maxima-Method


<!---
 **Attention: The scripts are mostly not standalone as a High Performance Cluster was used!** 
--->
This repository contains the code used to reproduce the simulation study results and case study findings of the paper:

**BÃ¼cher, A. and Staud, T. (2025+): Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method. To appear in: *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Statistical Methodology).***

## Repository Structure

The repository mainly consists of the folder **`publication`**.  
The auxiliary directory *`Z_Archive`* is not relevant for reproduction purposes.  

Inside **`publication`**, the structure is organized as follows:

- **Section folders**  
  Each section of the main paper that contains figures produced in **R** has a dedicated folder named after the section.  
  - Each folder includes scripts for generating the figures.  
  - A subdirectory *`plots`* contains the resulting figures in PDF format.

- **Supplement**  
  Contains all scripts required to reproduce the figures in the supplementary material.  
  - A subdirectory *`plots`* holds the corresponding figures as PDF files.

- **backend**  
  Contains supporting material, including  
  - underlying datasets,  
  - source code, and  
  - a custom theme script used for the figures.

## Usage

To reproduce the figures, simply run the provided R scripts within the respective section or supplement folder.  
The generated output will be stored in the corresponding *`plots`* subdirectory.

<!---

-   **src**: Contains both the R- and Rcpp source code for the simulation study

-   **data**: Contains data generated by scripts of processing nature. **Attention**: raw data generated by the HPC is not uploaded as it would exceed the data storage capacity.

-   **results**: Contains the various plots produced.

-   **scripts**: Contains the various scripts used to generate/process data and plots.

    -   subfolders indicate simulation sub-studies which needed computational power aided by a High Performance Cluster (HPC) (provided by *ZIM: Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf*; for which we are grateful)
    -   R-scripts sent to the HPC need to be modified by hand to correct pathing
    -   raw data generated by the bash files sent to the HPC need to be generated by the user as they occupy too much disk space
    -   data not taking too much space can be found in the *data* subfolders
