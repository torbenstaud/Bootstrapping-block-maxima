# Bootstrapping-Estimators-based-on-the-Block-Maxima-Method

This repository contains the code used to reproduce simulation study results and case study findings of the paper: Bücher, Staud (2024): Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method.

**Attention: The scripts are mostly not standalone as a High Performance Cluster was used!**

The structure is as follows:
-   **publication**: Contains the scripts needed to reproduce the figures in the publication *Bücher, A. and Staud, T. (2025+): Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method. To appear in: Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Statistical Methodology)*.
-   **src**: Contains both the R- and Rcpp source code for the simulation study

-   **data**: Contains data generated by scripts of processing nature. **Attention**: raw data generated by the HPC is not uploaded as it would exceed the data storage capacity.

-   **results**: Contains the various plots produced.

-   **scripts**: Contains the various scripts used to generate/process data and plots.

    -   subfolders indicate simulation sub-studies which needed computational power aided by a High Performance Cluster (HPC) (provided by *ZIM: Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf*; for which we are grateful)
    -   R-scripts sent to the HPC need to be modified by hand to correct pathing
    -   raw data generated by the bash files sent to the HPC need to be generated by the user as they occupy too much disk space
    -   data not taking too much space can be found in the *data* subfolders
